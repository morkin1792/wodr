- {Number}
- {Word}
- {Word}{Number}
- {Word}{Symbol}{Number}
- {Word}{Number}{Symbol}

### Word

{Word} is usually:

1. Special Names: The own users' name/nickname or their loved ones, like "john", "alex", "bia".
2. Company Names: The name of the company that developed the app or service they are using, such as "Microsoft", "MS", "Micro", "Face".
3. Favorite words: Users sometimes choose obscure or quirky words that hold personal significance to them. "Pikachu," "God," or "Vina" could be examples of such words.

### Number

{Number} is usually:

1. Sequential Numbers: Sequences like "123" or "321" are easy to remember and commonly used by people to create passwords.
2. Repeating Digits: Patterns like "000", "333" or "55555" are memorable and also common.
3. Lucky Numbers: Some individuals use numbers they consider lucky, such as "777", "888" or "1010" as part of their passwords.
4. Year Patterns: People often incorporate special or recent years into their passwords, such as "1990", "2000" or "2021".
5. Special Dates: Many people use important dates, like their own or their loved ones' birthdates as part of their passwords. For example, "05121985", "20160403" or "0308John".
